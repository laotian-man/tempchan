Analysis of Kotchan:
- Standard Admin api (can probably reuse a lot? IDK maybe):
  - Ban, slient, delete, etc...
- Standard CRUD API for posts
- Sockets:
  - Unsubscribe and subscribe events to certain boards
  - Unsub never called
- Frontend
  - We can probably reuse a lot of this, just will have to rehook up the
    api endpoints
  - JS Files with functionality in index.html:
    - main.js
    - rules.js
    - disableanimation.js
    - chat.js
    - stickers.js
    - paste.js
- Must Refactor POST /chat/*
  - Needless async library usage
  - Learn the functionality, clean it up

- Overview of current chat flow:
  - Frontend makes POST /chat/* request to create chat message
  - Server emits "chat" event upon creation of message
    - Could slot in a request here to a discord webhook to provide discord chat functionality
  - Concurrent clients hear event, create local html element for chat
  - Current Flaws:
    - Chat messages arent being saved in DB

- (Long term goal) Database abstraction:
  - Provider (database specific) hooks up to database-independent workflow layer
  - Decouples database-specific logic from server logic, allows possibility to easily use other dbs in the future

- Message failures:
  - proxy
  - session_expiry
  - ban_violation
